           A smaller share of Americans with coronavirus cases have been admitted to hospitals during the surge of the Omicron variant than during previous waves, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday.<br>


        The report added to heartening signs from other countries and from certain health systems in the United States that Omicron, while highly contagious,<br>
         is causing less severe illness — a result of growing levels of immunity in the population, as well as Omicron itself often triggering less serious symptoms.<br>
        

        Yet the report also offers some cause for concern.<u>Because of soaring infection levels, the peak level of daily hospital admissions was higher than during previous surges.
                   </u> And deaths in the United States have risen in recent days.<br>
        

        The number of people infected with the coronavirus visiting emergency departments was 86 percent higher than during the Delta wave in the fall, the C.D.C. said, and the number of people with Covid admitted to the hospital was 76 percent higher.

    <P>ALBANY, N.Y. — Letitia James, the New York State attorney general, moved on Tuesday to block a ruling from a judge who struck down a state indoor mask requirement a day before, creating confusion across schools and businesses.<br>

        State officials said Ms. James had filed a motion to stay the ruling, which said the mask mandate violated the State Constitution, to try to put it on hold while the state files a formal appeal of the judge’s ruling.<br>
        
        Gov. Kathy Hochul had renewed a rule requiring masks or proof of full vaccination at all indoor public places throughout the state in December, amid a winter coronavirus surge, and said it would last a month. The state Health Department then extended the mandate an additional two weeks, to expire on Feb. 1.<br>
        
        In a six-page decision on Monday, State Supreme Court Justice Thomas Rademaker wrote that Ms. Hochul and state health officials lacked the authority to enact the mask rule without the approval of state lawmakers. Regardless of the “well aimed” intentions of state officials, such authority is “entrusted solely to the State Legislature,” Justice Rademaker wrote.<br>
        
        Ms. James filed a notice of intent to appeal the ruling on Monday night, the first step for a decision to be considered by an appellate court. Emily DeSantis, a spokeswoman for the state Education Department, said the department had informed its schools that, as the legal issues are resolved, “schools must continue to follow the mask rule.”<br>
        
        Justice Robert J. Miller of the state’s appellate division held a brief hearing on Tuesday afternoon to consider the motion to stay the ruling and said he would, “have a decision later in the day.”</P>
